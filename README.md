MyFirefox Contacts

Goal: Give users a way to access and manage their contacts from FXOS devices
and WebRTC-enabled FX clients.

This is one of a set of experimental identity-attached services that include:

- Passwords: https://github.com/mozilla/gombot
- Bookmarks and Tabs: https://github.com/mozilla/myfx-tabs
- Contacts: (this)
- Backend Server: https://github.com/mozilla/myfx-server
